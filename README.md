# 🧥 Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV

This project uses **computer vision** techniques to create an *invisibility cloak effect*, inspired by the Harry Potter movies. It works by detecting a specific color (e.g., red), capturing the background, and replacing the color area with the background in real-time video.

## 🎯 Features
- Real-time video processing with OpenCV
- Color detection using HSV masking
- Background capture and cloak replacement
- Adjustable color range for different cloak materials

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
